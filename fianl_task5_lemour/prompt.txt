I built a Python application called The Snow Accumulation Tracker, which is designed to help mountain road management teams monitor and identify areas with the highest snow accumulation. The program provides an interactive grid where users can click on cells to represent snow levels. It allows for easy visualization of snow accumulation and highlights the most heavily snowed area. Please examine if the application is working perfectly in the accumulation snow check, the cell of the snow is light blue and the grid background is white. The left mouse button should increase the snow level, and the right should decrease it.
